= iOS Metal demos

A few simple rendering demos I've written to get to grips with Apple's Metal API.

== 01_Basic3D

A tweaked version of Apple's Basic3D demo. The rendered image is the same as the original demo, but this version uses some helper classes/functions to setup various Metal buffers.

== 02_BasicPODScene

A simple mesh renderer. The PowerVR Object Data format (POD) is used to store the mesh data.
